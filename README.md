# Running Environment:
Package requirements:
```
- cfgrib
- xarray
- 
```

The best approach to install and run these is to create a dedicated conda environment. Pandas has difficulty ensuring that all of the packages are compatible with each other. A tutorial on conda environments can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#).
